      <h1>Dota 2</h1>
      <p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Valve.
        The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients,
        which was a community-created mode for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.</p>
      <p>Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending
        their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.
        During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
        A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

  <p class= "ti-desc">The 10th tournament of The International series was slated for August 2020. However, for objective reasons (COVID-19 pandemic), the tournament was postponed for 1 year.
     The International 10 (TI 10) has a record-breaking prize pool of just over $ 40 million.
     Due to the postponement of The International 2020, Valve has reset the DPC points earned by teams in the 2019-2020 season. In early 2021, teams had to re-confirm their eligibility for The International 2021 by scoring points in the DPC 2021: Season 1 and DPC Season 2 series.
    As a result, the top 12 teams won the coveted places at TI10. Another 6 participating teams will be determined based on the results of The International 2021 regional qualifiers.
    The format of the tournament remained unchanged. First, the participants will play in the group stage - 2 groups of 9 teams. The 8 best teams from each group will advance to the final article, which will be held in a double-elimination format.TI10 had the highest prize pool of all time among all competetive games played as a team.</p>
